    <p>
      i know it's a bit late, and as im completing this message it's 2pm on 18th February 2025, i just want to say
      that you're my everything. I've never felt this much love for anyone else in my life before, kahit family, kahit friends, kahit sino.
      You're the one that I have found all this love kept in my heart for, and to you I would give anything and everything, just to see
      you smile. God has gifted and blessed me with this love that I get to share with you, and through every difficult moment, through every
      fun time we have, I will always love you with all my heart, and in every way possible.<br></br.> 

      <br></br.>I love you more than I'm able to express, and more than anything in this world, and you truly are my everything.
      I'm sorry din if I ever do something wrong, and I want you to know that i'm always praying, and finding ways to be even better
      than before, for you. I truly want to be with you, and i want to be the best for you, and i want you to truly have everything this world
      can offer. <br></br.><br></br.>

      Thank you for everything my love, for making me laugh always, for the long gaming sessions we have, playing fisch together, playing horror games,
      watching horror movies, watching random movies, for always being supportive of me, for all your efforts, for taking care of me palagi emotionally,
      for being the best support system for me, and for always being patient through everything. and promiseeeee, for the first time in
      my life, I'm truly certain of one thing, and it's that I want to be yours forever, and i want to be your husband. 

      I love you with all my heart, and I hope you always know that i'm here always, to give you everything, and to be the best for you.
      I love you baby â™¡<br>
